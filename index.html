  <h1>Our goal is to build a Counterspace:</h1> 
  <p>a safe and intersectional desginated space at Paul G. Allen for marginalized students. We want to build this by the start of Fall quarter of the 2022-2023 school year. We understand that's an agressive goal, which is why all we are asking the leadership of Paul g. Allen to do is to provide us with a designated room. We have a team of willing student vollenteers that will work over summer quarter to ensure the safe space has been created on campus, with the goal of protecting our friends and peers.</p>
  
  <h2>Evidence-Based</h2>
    <p>Counterspaces in STEM have been shown to increase student retention through creating further student involvement and representation.</p>

  <h2>Proven-Need</h2>
    <p>A counterspace would resolve known issues on campus related to food insecurity, via providing student recourses. It would also provide a space for students to study without fear of law enforcement being called on them and would help to create peer-based study groups for marginalized students. This addresses the known issues that have been presented to the Director within the last 2 quarters of the 2021-2022 school year alone.</p>
 
  <h2>Low-Cost</h2>
    <p>As a student-led and student funded initiative, we are only asking for a designated room to create this space. We need and want this facility now and want to remove anything that might prevent Paul G. Allen School from allowing access to this immediately needed resource.</p>
