Are you someone who's an Alumni, Falculty, part of the greater University of Washington student body, or beyond? Do you still want to find a way to support our initiative? Sign up to be a sponsor!

Sponsors are listed on our volenteers page as a special way to say you or your orginization supports our student initiative for a Paul G. Allen Counterspace. Be sure to sign the petition too! We need everyone's support and advocacy to make this happen.
