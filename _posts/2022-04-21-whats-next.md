We need the commitment of Paul G. Allen School to make this happen. Our goal is to work to put together this counterspace over Summer 2022 so that it is prepared for the next transfer cohort and returning students for Fall quarter of the 2022-2023 school year. Understandably, this is a fast pace to work towards such a space, but the urgency of the matter makes this a main priority for the retention and success of a diverse student body. We are ready, willing, and able to put in the work to build a thriving campus community.  As a transfer cohort, we are inviting you to support us in building a safe school for students from all backgrounds.

Witnessing our friends be harmed by racism, ableism, and homophobia on campus is trauma.  Our campus community cannot thrive when we are being attacked with no space to retreat and heal from that trauma.  We know that there is a long road ahead.  We ask for Paul G. Allen to be equally committed to fighting against a traumatic and divisive learning environment. We are asking that you use the commitment set forth in the 5 year DEIA plan to support this initiative.  One that will support currently struggling undergraduate students at the Paul G Allen School.

We need space first. We can handle the rest.  Effort has been put forth to ensure our plan was researched, has clearly defined goals and milestones. We have prepared student volunteersâ€™ that are willing and able to facilitate the creation of the space and produce committed progress reports listing goals quarterly for the next 2 years as we establish this space on campus.

We ask you to kindly consider giving us this opportunity to improve inclusion and accessibility for students here at the Paul G. Allen School.
