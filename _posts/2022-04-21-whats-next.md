We need the commitment of Paul G. Allen School to make this happen. Our goal is to work to put together this counterspace over Summer 2022 so that it is prepared for the next transfer cohort and returning students for Fall quarter of the 2022-2023 school year. We understand that this is a fast pace to work towards such a space, but we feel the urgency of the matter makes this a main priority. We are ready, willing, and able to provide funding, volunteers hours, student coordination, and more so long as we have a designated safe space on campus to work within.

We don’t want to keep watching our friends experience harm and trauma of racism, ableism, and homophobia on campus. We know that we can’t resolve these issues overnight, and that Paul G. Allen is equally committed to fighting against such rhetoric. We are asking that you use that strong commitment to support this initiative that will support currently struggling students in the Undergraduate class.

All we need is a space. We will handle the rest. Effort has been put forth to ensure our plan was researched, has clearly defined goals and milestones.  Lee is willing and able to produce committed progress reports listing goals quarterly for the next 2 years as we establish this space on campus.  Drew is willing to facilitate the creation of the space.

We ask you to kindly consider giving us this opportunity to improve inclusion and accessibility for students here at the Paul G. Allen School.
